                  Which led me to branching out from Java and exploring modern CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to make this website. Taking inspiration from Bryantcode, I'll be messing with 3D models next.

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              As I was digging in my garage one day, I found an old laptop my dad owned. I opened it up, and I found the equivalent of an admin password completely locking down the computer. At the time, I really needed a laptop so I looked for ways ot bypass it. And in extremely uncertain terms I found a method called LPC bus shorting, which worked on previous models and hypothetically worked on this one, though no one commented they attempted it with my specific laptop's specs. I decided I wanted to change that. How it works is:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li> Find what chip the password is stored in (the EC)</li>
               <li> Find a slightly illegal schematic of your laptop's motherboard (not the same for every laptop)    </li>
               <li> Go into the schematic using some sort of viewer, and find the lins you need to short the EC    </li>
               <li> Short them for a split second while turning on the laptop and spam F1 or Enter to get into your BIOS    </li>
               <li> Boom, done, now reset Supervisor password    </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Thing is, it is really strict timing and I'm still trying to get it down before I finally make use of this laptop I don't even need anymore

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              I got a tiny device called the
              <a href="https://flipperzero.one/" target="_blank">Flipper Zero, a tiny little device that can pen test wifi and emulate NFC tags!</a>
              I mainly use it as a passkey for documents, to emulate amiibos when I play on my old switch, or even to record hotel keys to give myself an extra when I'm out traveling. I deepdived into the little thing and I found out that hypothetically become a music player, so why not make an attachment to it and make that a reality? The answer is it's hard. I'm talking electrical engineering with a fully finished bachelors hard, but I didn't let that stop me. So far in my drafts I researched what a common mp3 player would have hardware wise, and I ordered every single one of the aprts and a breadboard so i can get a prototype going before I fianlize the parts into a pre-built board I'd order from china. This includes the DAC module, the Lithium battery, the components of the AMP circuit, MicroSD slot, charging circuit. I got everything (Thank you Ali-Express), and it's soon to be put together so I can begin bug testing and creating software for real-world use. Personally excited for this one as it turns my expensive paperweight into something cool I always have a reason to carry with me.
