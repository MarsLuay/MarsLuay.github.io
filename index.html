              I graduated from Auburn Mountainview High School in 2023, and I am currently at Green River College on a pathway to transfer to the University of Washington, aiming for a double major in Computer Engineering and Software.

              I have learned Java, HTML, calculus, and physics while completing my core classes at Green River, which has fully prepared me for the specialized courses I will be taking next.

                  Which led me to branch out from Java and explore modern CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to make this website. Taking inspiration from Bryantcodes, I'll be experimenting with 3D models next.

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              As I was digging in my garage one day, I found an old laptop my dad owned. I opened it up and found the equivalent of an admin password completely locking down the computer. At the time, I really needed a laptop, so I looked for ways to bypass it. And, in uncertain terms, I found a method called LPC bus shorting, which worked on previous models and hypothetically worked on this one, though no one had reported attempting it with my specific laptop's specs. I decided I wanted to change that. How it works is:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li> Find which chip the password is stored in (the EC).</li>
               <li> Find a slightly illegal schematic of your laptop's motherboard (not the same for every laptop).</li>
               <li> Open the schematic using some sort of viewer, and find the lines you need to short on the EC.</li>
               <li> Short them for a split second while turning on the laptop, and spam F1 or Enter to get into the BIOS.</li>
               <li> Boom—done. Now reset the Supervisor password.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The thing is the timing is really strict, and I'm still trying to get it down before I can finally make use of this laptop I don't even need anymore.

          <h2 class="title">3. Turning a hacking device into an MP3 player</h2>
          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              I got a device called the
              <a href="https://flipperzero.one/" target="_blank">Flipper Zero, which can pentest Wi-Fi and emulate NFC tags!</a>
              I mainly use it as a passkey for documents, to emulate Amiibo when I play on my old Switch, or even to record hotel keys to give myself an extra copy when I'm traveling. I dove deep into it and found that it could hypothetically become a music player, so why not make an attachment and make that a reality? The answer: it's hard—like “electrical engineering bachelor's degree” hard. So far in my drafts, I researched what a common MP3 player would include hardware-wise, and I ordered every single one of the parts and a breadboard so I can get a prototype going before I finalize the parts into a pre-built board I'd order from China. This includes the DAC module, the lithium battery, the components of the amp circuit, MicroSD slot, and charging circuit. I got everything (thank you, AliExpress), and it's soon to be put together so I can begin bug testing and creating software for real-world use. I'm especially excited for this one, as it turns my expensive paperweight into something cool I always have a reason to carry.
